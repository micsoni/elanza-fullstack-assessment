## Considerations

### Things I would improve with more time:

- Finish all stories in the sprint
- Automated tests both in back-end and front-end
- Error handling 
- Improve overall UI/UX
- Consider migration to typescript 

###  Stories finished

- As a client I want to have a page where I can post a new care request  ✔️
- As a caregiver I want to have an overview of the open requests on the homepage in a simple list  ✔️
- As a caregiver I want to see the details of a request when clicking on it  ✔️
- As a caregiver I want to be able to apply to a request by clicking a button  ✔️
- As a client I want a request to be closed as soon as an application comes in  ✔️
- As a user I want the data to be persisted in a database  ⬜
- As a caregiver I want to have the request overview in a nice looking calendar format  ⬜
